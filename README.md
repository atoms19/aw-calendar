# Atom Calendar

Atom Calendar is a daily planner app designed to make it easier to organize your busy schedule. Despite its name, it functions more as a planner than a traditional calendar.

Unlike work-oriented calendar apps like Google or Outlook Calendar that offer features essential for scheduled meetings, sharable calendars, and managing team events, Atom Calendar is an entirely different app.

## What Makes Atom Calendar Unique
Atom Calendar is designed for personal use with in-device data storage. There is no way to share or synchronize calendars with others, ensuring that all your information stays private and local. While it is aimed primarily at students, it remains flexible enough for working adults seeking a simple organizational tool.

### Privacy First
A strong focus on privacy ensures that your tasks and events are stored securely on your device. With no data sent to a server, your agenda is safe from external access or web scraping. This privacy feature makes Atom Calendar an ideal tool for journaling or keeping a diary.

## No Time Blocking
Atom Calendar deliberately avoids time blocking. While time blocking may work for some, it often adds stress and complexity, especially for students who may not need such rigid schedules.

Instead of creating rigid time blocks for events, Atom Calendar only stores what needs to be done on a particular day. This approach allows you to scale the rescheduling window by days rather than minutes, offering a more relaxed and adaptable planning method.

## Powerful Event System
Atom Calendar provides a flexible, well-thought-out event system with the following features:

1. **Event Notes**: Take notes related to the event.
2. **Event Location**: Remember where an event takes place.
3. **Event Subtasks**: Add a checklist of tasks related to the event.
4. **Event Expense**: Track expenses or income related to the event.

For example, when planning a trip, you can create an event called "Trip to Bangalore," set the location, add a checklist of places to visit, and track trip expenses.

## Extensive Notes Support
Atom Calendar’s notes feature supports full Markdown, enabling you to:

- Add citations, images via links, and embeds.
- Use Katex for mathematical notes.
- Create code blocks with syntax highlighting for nearly all programming languages.

This makes Atom Calendar ideal for taking detailed notes during events like workshops.

## Recurring Events
Atom Calendar supports repeating events, allowing each occurrence to store individual information.

- Create journal entries every Sunday.
- Set daily reminders for prayer or other activities.
- Use repeating events with checklists to track regular workouts or other habits.

## Tracking Progress
Repeating events with checklists are powerful for habit tracking. You can access a monthly report from the "Monthly Overview" screen to see how many times you completed each task or habit.

## Monthly Overview
The "Monthly Overview" screen provides insights into your month, including:

- Total money spent and earned, aggregated from event expenses.
- Gross income or loss.
- Habit completion stats.

Access this report by tapping on the month name.
